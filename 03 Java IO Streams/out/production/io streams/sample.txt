Java is a widely used programming language.
It is fast, secure, and reliable. Java is everywhere â€” on mobile, web, desktop, and embedded systems.
Many developers enjoy coding in Java because of its rich API and strong community support.

However, sometimes Java throws an error that developers need to debug.
Error handling is an important skill in Java and helps improve code quality.

If an error occurs, developers check the stack trace and try to fix it quickly.
A good developer learns from each error and avoids repeating the same mistakes.
